# gaia python client

## running

To connect to a running Gaia server, find the host (open an ssh tunnel to it if needed) and do the following:

```
import gaia
config = {'gaia_host': 'localhost:24442'}
flow = gaia.Gaia(config)
```

Now that we have a client object `flow`, we can call these methods:

* upload - upload a new workflow (properties, Commands, and Steps)
* workflows - enumerate current workflows with summary information about each one
* command - see what Commands are available and add new Commands to a new or existing workflow
* merge - update or add new Steps to a new or existing workflow
* halt - stop a running workflow
* run - resume running a workflow
* status - get debugging details about a given workflow
* expire - run the Steps needed to (re)-output the given files and/or Steps as well as their dependent Steps

### upload

To get something running, upload a test workflow:

```
commands = gaia.load_yaml('my-commands.yaml')
steps = gaia.load_yaml('my-steps.yaml')
flow.upload('crick_experiment_20191130.121500', dict(owner='crick'), commands, steps)
```

Each workflow needs a unique name. Best practice is to construct a name in the
form `owner_program_datetime`.

You will also need to launch some sisyphus workers. To do that
[NOTE: This part is in flux]:

```
flow.launch(['a', 'b'])
```

Launch more if you want : ) Give each a unique name.
They will deallocate 5 minutes after finishing their last Steps.

### workflows

To list current workflows and get info on them as a map from workflow name
to its summary info:

```python
flow.workflows()
```


### command

Commands are the base level operations that can be run, specifically: command line programs in a given docker container image. Once defined, a Command can be invoked any number of times with a new set of vars, inputs, and outputs.

If you call this method with an empty or absent array argument, it will return all Commands in the named workflow.

```
flow.command('biostream')
# [{'name': 'ls', 'image': 'ubuntu', ...}, ...]
```

A Command is expressed as a dictionary with the following keys:

* name - name of the Command
* image - docker image to run in
* command - array of shell tokens to execute
* inputs - map of storage keys to internal paths inside the docker container where the Command's input files will be placed
* outputs - map of storage keys to internal paths inside the docker container where the Command's output files will be retrieved after the Command has run
* vars - map of var keys to string values to insert into Command tokens

They may also have an optional `stdout` key which specifies what path to place stdout output (so that stdout can be used as one of the outputs of the command).

```
flow.command('biostream', [...])
```

If `flow.command()` is called with an array of Command entries it will merge the given Commands into the workflow, thus adding and/or replacing Commands and triggering the recomputation of any Steps that refer to these Commands.

### merge

Once some Commands exist in the workflow you can start merging in Steps to run. Every Step names a Command and sets the Command's vars, inputs, and outputs. Inputs and outputs refer to paths in the data store. Vars are strings that can be spliced into various parts of the Command's shell tokens.

Commands and Steps are kept in *workflows* which are entirely encapsulated from one another. Each workflow has its own data space with its own set of names and values.

To call the `merge` method, provide a workflow name and an array of Steps:

```
flow.merge('biostream', [{'name': 'ls-home', 'command': 'ls', 'inputs': {...}, ...}, ...])
```

Each Step is a dictionary with the following keys:

* name - name of the Step
* command - name of the Command to invoke
* inputs - map of input keys defined by the Command to keys in the data store to read the input files
* outputs - map of output keys from the Command to keys in the data store to write the output files after successfully invoking the Command
* vars - map of var keys to values. If this is an array it will create a Step for each element in the array with the given value

If this is a Step with a name that hasn't been seen before, it will create the Step entry and trigger the computation of outputs if the required inputs are available in the data store.  If the `name` of the Step being merged already exists in the workflow, that Step will be updated and recomputed, along with all Steps that depend on outputs from the updated Step in that workflow.

### run

The `run` method simply triggers the computation in the provided workflow if it is not already running:

```
flow.run('biostream')
```

### halt

The `halt` method will immediately cancel all running tasks and stop the computation in the given workflow:

```
flow.halt('biostream')
```

### status

The `status` method provides debugging information about a given workflow. There is a lot of information available. It's formatted as a dictionary with these keys:

* state - a string representing the state of the overall workflow. Possible values are 'initialized', 'running', 'complete', 'halted', and 'error'.
* flow - contains a representation of the Steps in the workflow as a bipartite graph: `step` and `data`. Each entry has a `from` field containing Step or data names it is dependent on and a `to` field containing all Step or data names dependent on it. 
* data - contains a map of data keys to their current status: either missing or complete
* tasks - contains information about each task to run

```
flow.status('biostream')
```

### expire

The `expire` method accepts a workflow and a list of Steps names and storage paths (storage keys). It makes those Steps and their dependent Steps have to run again.

```
flow.expire('biostream', ['ls-home', 'genomes', â€¦])
```
